I mean it's a\n      game, that's clear. You buy the first dimension, and it gives you antimatter, and the second dimension\n      provides more first dimensions and so on... But what does it mean? It can't just be a game, it seems too\n      plain for that. The developer must have made it as a metaphor. I was doing my weekly ritual of using the\n      fingernail clipper to cut my pubic hair, when finally the realization came to me. The dimensions are just\n      thinly veiled misspellings of the word 'depression'. Regular matter are the cruel and negative thoughts that\n      add to and fuel depression, while antimatter is the positive thoughts and good friends that dispel it. You\n      start off with something simple, and it fights almost imperceptibly against the depression, but as you keep\n      going the fight builds. But it never seems to fix everything. The depression seems like it could go on to\n      infinity. So you keep going. But eventually, you figure out, depression isn't infinite. It's just very very\n      large. But your 'dimensions' eventually, with enough work, make enough 'antimatter' to usurp that seeming\n      infinity of depression. Then the possibilities are endless. You are actually happy for once, and your\n      happiness grows exponentially as you go beyond and seemingly 'break' the 'infinity' of depression. And you\n      go on until that 'infinity' seems tiny in comparison to the happiness you've managed to achieve in your\n      life, where if you reset you get over that infinity in less than the blink of an eye. If you want to know\n      what the multiple layers of prestige are...'Dimensional Shifts' are getting new things and methods to give\n      you happiness. 'Dimension Boosts' are upgrading the things and methods. Examples would be getting a new car\n      being a 'Dimensional Shift' and trading that car in for a new one would be a 'Dimension Boost'. 'Eternities'\n      are major tragedies such as a loved one dying. That lapse brings you straight back to the beginning, with\n      seemingly no hope of return. But with time, you grow back stronger and happier than ever before. 'Dimensional\n      Sacrifice' is moving away. You have to give up a lot of the things you had that made you happy, but there is\n      new opportunity in where you move to. And that new opportunity gives you more happiness than you ever had.\n      'Tickspeed' is how easy it is to make you happy, and 'Time Dimensions' make it even easier to be happy.\n      Antimatter Dimensions is a metaphor for a depressed man's successful battle against his illness.`,\n\n  get unlocked() {\n    return PlayerProgress.eternityUnlocked();\n  }\n\n}, {\n  id: \"a114\",\n  text: `(Make me sleep) Put me to sleep inside.

An M press actually has three parts to it: when M is pressed, when M is\n      held, and when M is released. Now, usually is the pressing that's useful because that's the only part that\n      matters; however, sometimes it's sufficient to just use the holding part, which also buys dimensions and\n      tickspeed upgrades. And as for the release, well, there are currently no cases where that's useful or\n      important, so don't worry about that part. Now, if we map out the required presses for challenge 2 it would\n      look like this: /¯\\\\. We merely need to hold (¯) M to reach the first galaxy, we need to press (/) M to\n      finish the challenge, and we need to press M again to start another challenge. So, how many presses is that\n      total? Well, it appears to be three, and if we were doing this Eternity in isolation then yes, it would be\n      three, but in a full-game M Button Challenge run there are other M presses that occur earlier in the run,\n      such as the M press needed for the first Infinity, so if we take that M press into consideration as well,\n      then how many M presses does it take? The naive answer would be four: one to enter the challenge, and the\n      three within the challenge we established earlier; however, we can do better. We can actually do it in\n      three by simply holding out the first M press to be used for the half M press, because the half M press only\n      required M to be held, not actually pressed, so in this fashion, Challenge 2 only adds on an additional two M\n      presses to the run, since the first M press just leeches off the previous M press. So to capture this\n      phenomenon, we call it 2.5 M presses. On a single Eternity basis, you'd round up that up to three, but in\n      a full game run, you'd round it down to two. So, in conclusion, since that first M press counts in some\n      contexts, but adds no additional presses in other contexts, we refer to it as a \"Half M Press\".`\n}, {\n  id: \"a260\",\n  text: `It seems that the Replicanti have a very divide-and-conquer method of doing things.\n      Well, everything at this rate.`,\n\n  get unlocked() {\n    return PlayerProgress.eternityUnlocked() || PlayerProgress.replicantiUnlocked();\n  }\n\n}, {\n  id: \"a261\",\n  text: `Antimatter Dimensions is actually a Roguelite game!

Thousands of hours of time,\n      planning, effort, consultation, and political manoeuvring to create truly airbreaking endeavours. Take the\n      Realmway Revitalisation Roadmap, a revolutionary program referred to by the 3 R's, which is known as the\n      pinnacle of the most famous of the empire's bureaucratic infrastructure committees - the EMIF (empire magic\n      infrastructure foundation) - not to be confused with the EAIF (Electric airship investment fund) or the\n      NMIC (National Magical Infrastructure Coalition). The goal of the three R's, set out by the EMIF, was to\n      reinstate a mana trade corridor for SMSS (Small-Medium Steam Shuttles), a vital part of the burgeoning\n      consolidated states after their unfortunate pillaging during the NELC (ninth empire liberation crusade).\n      The three R's was a multi stage project - stage 1 was a survey glyph in the air - all big things start with\n      a small step. Stage 2, the unveiling of the EMOF (Empire Mechanical Obliteration Forcefield) had over 50\n      dignitaries - multiple emperors (from federated states to organisational leaders), foreign rulers, EMDF\n      (Effluent Manifested Destiny Families) who currently own the land, and even some of the forecast witches,\n      all gathered together to unveil the project in a show of EOSF (Empire Official Solidarity Friendships).\n      Sadly, the project was eventually cancelled at stage 215, as the creation of the EMTF (Excrement Material\n      Transmutation Facility) for the contractors exploded after coming into contact with a SMEA (Small-Medium\n      Electric Airship) placing the last survey peg from stage 459 due to a time vortex created by an argument\n      at the WAIC (Witches Annual Infrastructure Committee) as part of stage 56. Truly, tragic stuff - 3 award\n      nominations and 2 wins during that process due to EBIF (Efficient Bureaucracy In (the) Field).`\n}, {\n  id: \"a370\",\n  text: \"Man tries installing cookies to store computer data, accidentally cleans them due to being too delicious.\"\n}, {\n  id: \"a371\",\n  text: `Pop quiz: there are 3 doors, you pick a door at random, and get to keep what's behind the door.

As the object grew in size and began to exhibit anomalous properties, he attempted to take control of the object by remotely activating the weather.  Upon doing so, he triggered a nuclear winter that killed tens of millions of people, and caused the entire universe to be converted to standard-bearer format, thus endowing him with a veto over any and all changes made to the standard-bearer format.  As the object's power grew, so did the need to make more and more advanced object that would allow him to remotely activate the weather, eventually creating what is now the largest aurora the world has ever known, larger even than the 326,500 tonnenenenenenene nebulae that were previously held in reserve.  As the object's power grew, so did the need to send more and more satellites into space, eventually reaching inter-universal satellite communication, making him the first living creature to ever experience such an event.  He also touched down safely at the same airport at the same time as the object, in case he was ever in the vicinity.  Finally, he opened an email that was sent to him by an unknown person, in which they discussed the possibility of a step-by-step guide for creating antimatter objects, in which he can at least offer some direction in how the world can be saved from itself.  He also mentioned that he was going to make a new ticker suggestion, but when he reached the end of the ticker he realized that it was a duplicate of another ticker, and he had mistakenly typed it in wrong.

I mean it's a\r\n      game, that's clear. You buy the first dimension, and it gives you antimatter, and the second dimension\r\n      provides more first dimensions and so on... But what does it mean? It can't just be a game, it seems too\r\n      plain for that. The developer must have made it as a metaphor. I was doing my weekly ritual of using the\r\n      fingernail clipper to cut my pubic hair, when finally the realization came to me. The dimensions are just\r\n      thinly veiled misspellings of the word 'depression'. Regular matter are the cruel and negative thoughts that\r\n      add to and fuel depression, while antimatter is the positive thoughts and good friends that dispel it. You\r\n      start off with something simple, and it fights almost imperceptibly against the depression, but as you keep\r\n      going the fight builds. But it never seems to fix everything. The depression seems like it could go on to\r\n      infinity. So you keep going. But eventually, you figure out, depression isn't infinite. It's just very very\r\n      large. But your 'dimensions' eventually, with enough work, make enough 'antimatter' to usurp that seeming\r\n      infinity of depression. Then the possibilities are endless. You are actually happy for once, and your\r\n      happiness grows exponentially as you go beyond and seemingly 'break' the 'infinity' of depression. And you\r\n      go on until that 'infinity' seems tiny in comparison to the happiness you've managed to achieve in your\r\n      life, where if you reset you get over that infinity in less than the blink of an eye. If you want to know\r\n      what the multiple layers of prestige are...'Dimensional Shifts' are getting new things and methods to give\r\n      you happiness. 'Dimension Boosts' are upgrading the things and methods. Examples would be getting a new car\r\n      being a 'Dimensional Shift' and trading that car in for a new one would be a 'Dimension Boost'. 'Eternities'\r\n      are major tragedies such as a loved one dying. That lapse brings you straight back to the beginning, with\r\n      seemingly no hope of return. But with time, you grow back stronger and happier than ever before. 'Dimensional\r\n      Sacrifice' is moving away. You have to give up a lot of the things you had that made you happy, but there is\r\n      new opportunity in where you move to. And that new opportunity gives you more happiness than you ever had.\r\n      'Tickspeed' is how easy it is to make you happy, and 'Time Dimensions' make it even easier to be happy.\r\n      Antimatter Dimensions is a metaphor for a depressed man's successful battle against his illness.`,\r\n    get unlocked() { return PlayerProgress.eternityUnlocked(); }\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: \"a114\",\r\n    text:\r\n      `(Make me sleep) Put me to sleep inside.

But we're\r\n      concerned about the troubling trend of responsible, two-sided news stories plaguing the antimatter\r\n      universe. The sharing of unbiased and true news has become all too common on social media. More\r\n      alarmingly, some media outlets publish these same true stories, stories that aren't just propaganda,\r\n      without checking government talking points first. Unfortunately, some members of the media use their\r\n      platforms to push a logically sound opinion and unbiased agenda to diversify 'exactly what antimatter\r\n      thinks'. This is extremely dangerous to our dictatorship. At ANN it's our responsibility to pursue\r\n      and report the lies. We understand lies are neither 'left or right' politically. Our commitment to\r\n      fearmongering slander is the foundation of our credibility, now more than ever.

An M press actually has three parts to it: when M is pressed, when M is\r\n      held, and when M is released. Now, usually is the pressing that's useful because that's the only part that\r\n      matters; however, sometimes it's sufficient to just use the holding part, which also buys dimensions and\r\n      tickspeed upgrades. And as for the release, well, there are currently no cases where that's useful or\r\n      important, so don't worry about that part. Now, if we map out the required presses for challenge 2 it would\r\n      look like this: /¯\\\\. We merely need to hold (¯) M to reach the first galaxy, we need to press (/) M to\r\n      finish the challenge, and we need to press M again to start another challenge. So, how many presses is that\r\n      total? Well, it appears to be three, and if we were doing this Eternity in isolation then yes, it would be\r\n      three, but in a full-game M Button Challenge run there are other M presses that occur earlier in the run,\r\n      such as the M press needed for the first Infinity, so if we take that M press into consideration as well,\r\n      then how many M presses does it take? The naive answer would be four: one to enter the challenge, and the\r\n      three within the challenge we established earlier; however, we can do better. We can actually do it in\r\n      three by simply holding out the first M press to be used for the half M press, because the half M press only\r\n      required M to be held, not actually pressed, so in this fashion, Challenge 2 only adds on an additional two M\r\n      presses to the run, since the first M press just leeches off the previous M press. So to capture this\r\n      phenomenon, we call it 2.5 M presses. On a single Eternity basis, you'd round up that up to three, but in\r\n      a full game run, you'd round it down to two.

Thousands of hours of time,\r\n      planning, effort, consultation, and political manoeuvring to create truly airbreaking endeavours. Take the\r\n      Realmway Revitalisation Roadmap, a revolutionary program referred to by the 3 R's, which is known as the\r\n      pinnacle of the most famous of the empire's bureaucratic infrastructure committees - the EMIF (empire magic\r\n      infrastructure foundation) - not to be confused with the EAIF (Electric airship investment fund) or the\r\n      NMIC (National Magical Infrastructure Coalition). The goal of the three R's, set out by the EMIF, was to\r\n      reinstate a mana trade corridor for SMSS (Small-Medium Steam Shuttles), a vital part of the burgeoning\r\n      consolidated states after their unfortunate pillaging during the NELC (ninth empire liberation crusade).\r\n      The three R's was a multi stage project - stage 1 was a survey glyph in the air - all big things start with\r\n      a small step. Stage 2, the unveiling of the EMOF (Empire Mechanical Obliteration Forcefield) had over 50\r\n      dignitaries - multiple emperors (from federated states to organisational leaders), foreign rulers, EMDF\r\n      (Effluent Manifested Destiny Families) who currently own the land, and even some of the forecast witches,\r\n      all gathered together to unveil the project in a show of EOSF (Empire Official Solidarity Friendships).\r\n      Sadly, the project was eventually cancelled at stage 215, as the creation of the EMTF (Excrement Material\r\n      Transmutation Facility) for the contractors exploded after coming into contact with a SMEA (Small-Medium\r\n      Electric Airship) placing the last survey peg from stage 459 due to a time vortex created by an argument\r\n      at the WAIC (Witches Annual Infrastructure Committee) as part of stage 56.

Upon doing so, he triggered a nuclear winter that killed tens of millions of people, and caused the entire universe to be converted to standard-bearer format, thus endowing him with a veto over any and all changes made to the standard-bearer format.  As the object's power grew, so did the need to make more and more advanced object that would allow him to remotely activate the weather, eventually creating what is now the largest aurora the world has ever known, larger even than the 326,500 tonnenenenenenene nebulae that were previously held in reserve.  As the object's power grew, so did the need to send more and more satellites into space, eventually reaching inter-universal satellite communication, making him the first living creature to ever experience such an event.  He also touched down safely at the same airport at the same time as the object, in case he was ever in the vicinity.  Finally, he opened an email that was sent to him by an unknown person, in which they discussed the possibility of a step-by-step guide for creating antimatter objects, in which he can at least offer some direction in how the world can be saved from itself.  He also mentioned that he was going to make a new ticker suggestion, but when he reached the end of the ticker he realized that it was a duplicate of another ticker, and he had mistakenly typed it in wrong.
